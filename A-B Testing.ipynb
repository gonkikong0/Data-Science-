    "# A/B Testing -\n",
    "Scientists do more than just observing data and making qunatitative judgements about it. But the job is more than just observing the preexisting differences. A huge part of science consists of creating differences experimentally and then drawing conclusions. Here we discuss, how to conduct those kinds of experiments in business. <br>\n",
    "Starts of by discussing the need for experimentation and our motivations for testing. Moves to, how to properly setup experiements, including the need for randomization. Next, details of A/B testing and the champion/challenger framework. End by describing nuancces like the exploration/exploitatoin trade off, as well as ethical concerns."

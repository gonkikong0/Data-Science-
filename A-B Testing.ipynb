    "# A/B Testing -\n",
    "Scientists do more than just observing data and making qunatitative judgements about it. But the job is more than just observing the preexisting differences. A huge part of science consists of creating differences experimentally and then drawing conclusions. Here we discuss, how to conduct those kinds of experiments in business. <br>\n",
    "Starts of by discussing the need for experimentation and our motivations for testing. Moves to, how to properly setup experiements, including the need for randomization. Next, details of A/B testing and the champion/challenger framework. End by describing nuances like the exploration/exploitatoin trade off, as well as ethical concerns."

    "Running experiments may not sound so difficult, but some tricky parts are important to get exactly right. We need data from two groups, A group that has received a blue-text email and a group that has received a black-text email.

    "After that, we can do a simple t-test to determine whether revenue collected from the blue-text group differed significantly from the revenue collected from the black-text group. We are going to use the 5 percent significance level for all of our tests -- We'll reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis if the <i>p-value</i> is lower than 0.05. When we do our tests, if the revenues are significantly different, we can reject our null hypothesis."

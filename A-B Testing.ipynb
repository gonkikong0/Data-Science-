    "What we did just now is an <i>experiment</i>, Splitting the population into two groups, performed different actions on each group and compared the results.

If so, our A/B test didn't test for the effect of blue text but rather for the effect of age and wealth. We intended to study only the effect of text color in this A/B test and now we don't know whether we truly studied that or whether we studied age, wealth or something else.
